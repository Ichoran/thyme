Thyme and Parsley are microbenchmarking and profiling utilities.

This is version 0.1.1.

A couple of things to keep in mind before you start:
  (1) Context is important!  (Especially for tricky JIT compilation and GC.)
  (2) The JIT will skip work if it can--always return an answer in a
      microbenchmark, and make it depend on everything you do.

If you want to build the project, just compile everything in maths
together and then everything in bench--that works fine.  If you're on
a Unixy system, there's makefile which works also (and builds the docs).

If you use sbt, in sbt just type "run" to compile then you will will
be offered a list of the included examples to run.

There are no dependencies save Scala 2.10 itself.

Thyme.jar is included (or you can just grab the jar itself).  Why not try it
out!  You can do it right in the REPL, like so:

$ scala -cp Thyme.jar

Parsley is a local profiler that also can be useful.  Try this, then check
the source code of bench/Examples.scala to see what's happening (tldr--it
measures the relative time taken by three different methods as they do
they're thing embedded in some other code):

$ scala -cp Thyme.jar ichi.bench.examples.ParsleyExample
Parsley profiling, 3564 ticks sampled
Fractional time taken: 
   46.971% +- 0.836%   = Method 2
   26.192% +- 0.736%   = Method 3
   23.584% +- 0.711%   = Method 1

    1. Added argument to allow Thyme.warmed to partially warm an
instance.
